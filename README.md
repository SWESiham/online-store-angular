# üõçÔ∏è Online Store ‚Äì Final Project (ITI Summer Angular Training)

This project is the **Final Project** for the **Summer Angular Training by ITI**, showcasing the full implementation of a responsive and modular **Online Store Web Application** using Angular and TypeScript.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

An e-commerce web application where users can:
- Browse products by category
- Search for products or categories
- View product details
- Add products to a cart
- Control quantity and calculate total price
- Perform CRUD operations (add/edit/delete/search) on products with validations

The app is built with **component-based architecture**, uses **Bootstrap** for styling, and connects to a mock RESTful API via `json-server`.
